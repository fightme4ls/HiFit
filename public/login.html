        <p>
            HiFit is a fitness application designed to help users track their workouts and achieve their fitness goals.
            Users can input their weight, target weight, goals (running, weightlifting), log each workout
            to track their progress, and visually track their weight goal progress with a progress bar.
           There are separate forms used for weight tracking and logging runs and workouts, which when submitted
           store the users progress in our database, allowing users to see their past workouts and the progress
           they are making.

        <h3>Database Implementation<img src="images/database.png" alt="database" class = "small-image"></h3>
        <p>
            For the establishment of the database infrastructure, we chose to use MySQL, a robust and widely-adopted relational database management system.
            The initial phase involved meticulous planning and conceptualization of the table structure. 
            Once the blueprint for the database was defined, tables were systematically designed, complete with their respective attributes.
            To ensure comprehensive accessibility for the entire team, we decided to deploy the database on the Google Cloud platform. 
            The process involved establishing a seamless connection between MySQL Workbench and Google Cloud, subsequently initializing the database within this cloud environment.
            This methodical approach not only facilitated the creation of a well-organized and efficient database but also streamlined collaborative efforts by enabling remote access for the entire project team.
