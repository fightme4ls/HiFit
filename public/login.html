        <p>
            HiFit is a fitness application designed to help users track their workouts and achieve their fitness goals.
            Users can input their weight, target weight, goals (running, weightlifting), log each workout
            to track their progress, and visually track their weight goal progress with a progress bar.
           There are separate forms used for weight tracking and logging runs and workouts, which when submitted
           store the user's progress in our database, allowing users to see their past workouts and the progress
           they are making.
        </p>

        <h3>Database Implementation<img src="images/database.png" alt="database" class = "small-image"></h3>
        <p>
            For our project's database implementation, we decided to use MySQL, a simple database management system that we were familiar with in the past.
            To start with the MySQL, we worked on creating a database schema in order to store our data in which would make the most sense. 
            Once we created the schema, the query was created to create the tables along with storing the attributes and the creation query was distributed between the group members.
            After a few days of changing the database and needing people to update their own tables, we decided to deploy the database on the Google Cloud platform. 
            Deploying the database to Google Cloud allowed for everyone to access a single database which was hosted on the cloud rather than everyone creating their own local database. 
            Members would be able to access the Google Cloud SQL by connecting it with MySQL workbench in order to edit it. 
        </p>
   
        <h3>Obstacles<img src="images/obstacle.png" alt = "obstacle" class = "small-image"></h3>
        <p>We had to figure out how to track health metrics. We spent a lot of time designing the forms and making ideas on how to measure goals and progress.</p>
        <p>The database was infiltrated and deleted by a third party malicious program. To fix this problem, we improved our database security by going through and making sure our login
        information was secure and encrypted.</p>
